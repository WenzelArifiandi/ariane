          ### 📊 Summary
          - **Branches Found**: ${{ steps.find_branches.outputs.branch_count }}
          - **Successfully Merged**: ${{ env.merged_count || 'N/A (dry run)' }}
          - **Failed to Merge**: ${{ env.failed_count || 'N/A (dry run)' }}
          - **Dry Run**: ${{ inputs.dry_run }}

          ### 🎯 Next Steps
          1. Review the merged changes in the main branch
          2. Run security scans to verify vulnerability reduction
          3. Clean up merged branches if desired
          4. Monitor for any breaking changes

          ### 🛡️ Security Impact
          This merge consolidates multiple automated security fixes into main branch,
          significantly reducing the code scanning alert count.
