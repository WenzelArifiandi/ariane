## ⚡ Zero-Setup / Near-Zero Friction Testing & Security Controls

You asked for “world‑class, enterprise‑grade, uncompromising” **without paying** and ideally **without building custom frameworks**. This doc lists options you can flip on or reuse _now_ with almost no extra authoring.

### 1. Already Active (No Work Needed)

| Capability                  | Mechanism                   | Where                          |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Unit + Integration Harness  | Vitest + jsdom + MSW        | `vitest.config.ts`, `tests/`   |
| E2E / Cross‑Browser         | Playwright (config present) | `playwright.config.ts`         |
| Performance & Accessibility | Lighthouse CI               | `.lighthouserc.js`             |
| Static App Security (SAST)  | CodeQL Advanced             | `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` |
| Container / Image Scanning  | Trivy                       | `deploy-zitadel.yml`           |
| Dependency Audit            | `npm audit` (site & studio) | `deploy-zitadel.yml`           |
| Security Auto-Fix           | Custom script + workflow    | `security-autofix*.js`         |
| Branch Protection / CI Gate | `branch-protection.yml`     | GitHub Workflows               |

### 2. Turnkey Additions (Copy/Paste → Power On)

| Goal                     | Tool                                     | Effort    | Notes                               |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Secrets Scanning Upgrade | gitleaks                                 | 5 min     | Stronger than simple grep           |
| SBOM Generation          | Syft                                     | 5 min     | SPDX + CycloneDX artifacts          |
| License Compliance       | CycloneDX JSON + simple allowlist script | 10 min    | Fail on disallowed licenses         |
| DAST (Baseline)          | OWASP ZAP Baseline                       | 10–15 min | Non-blocking baseline mode          |
| Semgrep SAST Coverage    | Semgrep OSS                              | 5–10 min  | Adds broad rule pack                |
| Dependency Vuln Depth    | osv-scanner                              | 5 min     | Complements npm audit               |
| Policy Aggregation       | OPA / Conftest                           | 15–25 min | Start w/ coverage + high vuln rules |
| Mutation Strength Sample | Stryker (select dirs)                    | 20–30 min | Weekly only                         |

Each can be introduced **without rewriting** existing tests.

### 3. Modes: Minimal vs Hardened vs Continuous

| Mode                   | CI Time Budget | What’s Enabled                                               | Blocking?          |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Minimal (PR)           | < 8 min        | Lint, Types, Unit, Integration (fast), gitleaks, SBOM, audit | Coverage warn only |
| Hardened (main)        | 12–15 min      | + Playwright (chromium), Semgrep, osv, Trivy, ZAP baseline   | High vulns block   |
| Continuous (scheduled) | 20–30 min      | + Full Playwright matrix, mutation sample, deep Semgrep      | Strict gates       |

---

### 4. Absolutely Zero Custom Code Options

If you wanted to skip even MSW/tests authoring (not recommended long-term):

| Category             | Option                                        | Trade-offs                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| API Tests            | Thunder Client Collections (exported to repo) | Manual assertions, no automation gating |
| Generated Unit Tests | AI extensions (EarlyAI, Testent)              | May produce shallow assertions          |
| Runtime Smoke        | Playwright codegen (`npx playwright codegen`) | Requires maintenance when UI shifts     |
| Exploratory Security | ZAP Baseline only                             | Misses logic-specific flaws             |

These give quick surface coverage but lack depth vs curated hand-written tests.

---

### 5. Pre-Wired Scripts to Add

Add to root `package.json` (if / when you wire the turnkey tools):

```jsonc
{
  "scripts": {
    "scan:secrets": "gitleaks detect -f sarif -r gitleaks.sarif || true",
    "scan:sbom": "syft dir:. -o cyclonedx-json=sbom.cdx.json,spdx-json=sbom.spdx.json",
    "scan:osv": "osv-scanner --recursive --json . > osv.json || true",
    "scan:semgrep": "semgrep ci --sarif --output semgrep.sarif || true",
    "scan:licenses": "node scripts/license-check.js",
    "test:mutation": "stryker run",
    "scan:aggregate": "node scripts/aggregate-quality.js"
  }
}
```

All emit artifacts—can be uploaded or fed into OPA later.

---

### 6. Suggested Workflow Skeleton (Conceptual)

See `ENTERPRISE_TESTING_FREE.md` for the full blueprint; you can graft only the pieces you want now. Core idea: _parallelize security scans with test lanes_.

---

### 7. Minimal Policy (Optional Early Gate)

```
deny[msg] { input.coverage.global < 0.70; msg := "Coverage under 70%" }
deny[msg] { some v in input.vulns.high; msg := "High dependency vulnerability: " ++ v.id }
deny[msg] { some s in input.secrets; s.severity == "HIGH" }
```

Start in report-only (log), then switch to blocking after baseline stabilizes.

---

### 8. What NOT to Add (Yet)

| Thing                               | Why Defer                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Full fuzz harness                   | No complex parsers yet       |
| End-to-end visual regression        | UI footprint small right now |
| Distributed load testing            | No performance SLA defined   |
| Exhaustive mutation across codebase | Cost > value early           |

---

### 9. Fast Win Order (1-Hour Sprint)

1. gitleaks (secrets)
2. syft (SBOM) + upload
3. osv-scanner (vulns)
4. semgrep (non-blocking)
5. ZAP baseline (scheduled) – optional if time

That alone jumps maturity significantly.

---

### 10. Summary

You already have a strong core. By layering 4–6 lightweight scanners and a tiny policy gate, you get enterprise-style breadth **for free** with almost no bespoke code. Expand only when signal > noise.
